# Hotel-Reservation-System
This project is a desktop-based Hostel Reservation System built with Python Tkinter for the GUI. It allows students/guests to book hostel rooms, manage a waiting list using a queue data structure, reserve mess/dining tables, and handle bill payment for their stay and services.

The system is designed as a small-scale management tool for wardens or hostel admins to handle day-to-day room allocation, table booking, and payment tracking from a single interface.
